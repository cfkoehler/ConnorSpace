title: E-Ink Information display 1.0 Publish

I have been working the last few weeks to make a simple information display that uses E-Ink. Using a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a Waveshare 7.5 inch display I have gotten to the point of basic release. The code is not as clean as I would like but I went first for functionality and plan to clean it up and add more modularity in the future. They python code is simple to follow and uses as many built in libraries as I could find.

### So what does it do:

- Shows time which is usually a few minutes behind due to the long refresh rate
- Shows date and day of the week
- Shows current weather
- Shows 4 day weather forecast
- Shows tasks from todoist
- Shows upcoming rocket launches
- Shows Current US COVID numbers
- Shows US State COVID numbers
- Shows current stock price for 5 companies



### Github

The code is currently on GitHub with basic install instructions. It assumes you know your way around Raspberry Pi's and bash. I will eventually make more detail instructions but will need to reset the install and document every step.
