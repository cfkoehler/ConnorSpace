Hello!

I have tried to start a blog many times to share random thoughts and projects that I am working on. This is my latest attempt and hopefully it sticks. 

I am a software engineer by trade but into many different hobbies including photography, triathlon, 3d printing and small electronics work. 

Please enjoy my blog!
